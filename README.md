This repository containts TensorFlow code to learn the parameters for an equation that describes bacterial population growth
in the presence of an antibiotic from data provided by [Palmer et al](10.1038/ncomms8385).

The results from this are meant to be used in a bacterial evolution simulation, code found [here](github.com/rhys-saldanha/comp3200-simulation)
